# Vertical Mobility Initiative
I want to provide methods for the world's underpriviledged to achieve dreams that they would never have dared to have in the first place.

The Vertical Mobility Initiative is a project for all of human-kind to take part in, so pull-requests are welcome. If you want to join the discussion, please sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqob5ivFIcWvqnm6g80kQJWXedQC8uobnCgnoXLgWtZ381zA/viewform).

## Who I Am
I am Timothy Blumberg, a senior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Chinese. I personally have benefited greatly from this concept of `Vertical Mobility` in the US. I was born in a small town in TN with limited prospects and opportunity. I studied hard and was given the unbelievable opportunity to study at Duke University on a full need-based scholarship. I maintain the position that there are others in the United States and the world at large that would have been a better candidate for receiving the aid that I am receiving now. However, because I am in this position of great fortune, I aim to do my best to provide others with opportunities that they too felt they could never earn. 

## What VMI Is
The Vertical Mobility Initiative is the collection of individuals who aim to work together in order to provide the world's underpriviledged with opportunities to elevate their circumstances. Education is a force that shapes the lives of humanity world-wide, but it often falls short in providing these opportunities to everyone equally. The wealthy are disproportionately equipped to get the best education in order to get the best jobs in order to make the most money in order to have kids that get the best education *ad infinitum*.

The Vertical Mobility Initiative hopes to disruptively provide both the means and incentives for the world's underpriviledged to move vertically to a new position of financial and social stability. 

## How Can This Happen?
While I have ideas about how this all is going to work, I am not foolish enough to believe that I alone can change the course of millions of children's lives around the world. I do believe that we can collaboratively create programs to provide radical improvements to the lives of people all over planet Earth.
