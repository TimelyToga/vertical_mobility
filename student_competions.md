# Disseminating the Motivation for STEM Education

Robotics Competitions in India have been very popular in recent years in helping motivate the next generation to pursue STEM education with extreme fervency. Hackathons have been the genesis of many great companies and student projects merely because they incentized students to create something from beginning to end. While the immediate motivation for the participants is the glory / benefits received from winning the competition, the long-term effect is increased engagement of students with a positive educational force.
